# My statusbar for DWM

This little thing only has the Xlib python module as a dependancy. Also, because
I use f-strings, python 3.6 minimal. You should be quitting python 2 anyway.

It displays at least the time and cpu use on the upper status bar, and local
network information on the lower one. It's a pretty simple thing. Feel free to
mod the hell out of it.

## How to run it.

Just run it in the background. If you have the smarts to run DWM how you like,
then this shouldn't pose an issue. (Hint, the autorun.sh in ~/.dwm might be a
good place to start)
